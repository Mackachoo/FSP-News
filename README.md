## ðŸ”® Description

This is a simple news app that shows the top news stories from different countries and categories. The user can select a country from a dropdown menu, and the top news stories from that country are displayed. The user can also filter the news stories by category. This was done using the NewsAPI.

This project leverages a range of technologies and skills. It's built with Svelte, a modern JavaScript compiler, which is then compiled into highly efficient code for the browser. The project uses Svelte's reactivity features to update news stories dynamically based on the selected country or category. News data is fetched from NewsAPI, a straightforward API providing global news data.
